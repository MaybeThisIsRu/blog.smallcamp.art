			<h1>Hello world!</h1>
			<time datetime="2020-09-23">23 September 2020</time>

			<p>Welcome to SmallCamp! üëã</p>

			<p>
				We're a small community of friends, and friends of friends. üëØ
			</p>

			<p>
				And we intend to stay small. Well, why? There's a few reasons:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Less hassle to moderate for the admins/moderators who do
					this work in their free time.
				</li>
				<li>
					Affordable monthly server costs equals longevity. We want to
					be around for a while.
				</li>
				<li>
					Everyone feels more comfortable because the community avoids
					spam accounts and trolls.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Don't worry ‚Äî being a small community doesn't take away from
				your ability to talk to other Mastodon instances, or the
				Fediverse.
			</p>

			<h2>What is Mastodon?</h2>

			<p>
				That last bit might have been
				<abbr title="Too Much Information">TMI</abbr>. Let's talk about
				it.
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Join Mastodon</a> is an
				excellent site to get a sense of what Mastodon, the software
				that powers our community, is.
			</p>

			<p>Here's a fifteen-second primer:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Social networking, back in your hands.</p>
				<p>
					Follow friends and discover new ones among more than 4.4M
					people. Publish anything you want: links, pictures, text,
					video. All on a platform that is community-owned and
					ad-free.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				...and a two-minute video introduction, if that's more your
				thing:
			</p>

			<iframe
				src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IPSbNdBmWKE"
				allowfullscreen=""
				width="560"
				height="315"
				frameborder="0"
			></iframe>

			<p>
				My friend Kev Quirk has written a very detailed, excellent guide
				to all the basic features,
				<a href="https://kevq.uk/how-does-mastodon-work/"
					>How does Mastodon work?</a
				>, which also includes a bit about Fediverse and Federation:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					To explain Mastodon federation a little better, I‚Äôm going to
					use email as an analogy ‚Äì hopefully this will make things
					easier to digest.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Mastodon network is made up of individual servers,
					called Instances. If we use our email analogy; think of
					Mastodon as email as a whole. So if Mastodon is ‚Äúemail‚Äù,
					then an Instance would be an email provider. For example,
					Gmail, Hotmail, or Zoho.
				</p>
				<p>
					They‚Äôre all completely different servers that are run by
					completely different companies, but Gmail, Hotmail and Zoho
					can all send email to one another.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mastodon is the same. My instance, Fosstodon, is run my
					myself and my friend Mike. Yet we can Toot with thousands of
					other Mastodon servers around the world that we do not run.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<h2>Why SmallCamp?</h2>

			<p>
				SmallCamp uses a slightly modified version of Mastodon, called
				Hometown. This lets you and me only talk to people within
				SmallCamp. If you want to invite a friend over, feel free to do
				so. If the moderators are happy with some baseline checks, your
				friend will be added in and shown around. üòä
			</p>

			<p>
				If you're new, it is highly recommended that you introduce
				yourself with the
				<a href="https://smallcamp.art/web/timelines/tag/introduction"
					>#introduction</a
				>
				tag.
			</p>

			<p>
				We, quite simply, are a safe space. A larger goal is to become a
				place for you and your friends to feel comfortable not just
				showing your uber positive highlight reel, but also talk about
				personal, often difficult, content that other platforms tend to
				penalize.
			</p>

			<h2>Finding people to follow</h2>

			<p>
				Your <b>Home</b> timeline would look pretty bare to start with.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thankfully, people have volunteered themselves
				<a href="https://communitywiki.org/trunk"
					>on a website called Trunk</a
				>. Scroll down to ‚ÄúThe Lists‚Äù and just find people you find
				interesting, and give them a follow!
			</p>

			<p>It's usually easier to:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					copy their username (in the format of
					`@username@instance.com`)
					<ul>
						<li>
							for example, my handle is
							<a href="https://smallcamp.art/@ru"
								>@ru@smallcamp.art</a
							>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>paste it in SmallCamp's search field</li>
				<li>press the follow button</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
			<p>
				A code of conduct is available on
				<a href="https://smallcamp.art/about/more"
					>our community's about page</a
				>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b
					>Please be sure to skim through it, and as usual, DM me in
					case of any concerns.</b
				>
			</p>

			<h2>Funding</h2>

			<p>
				If you'd like to contribute (once, or monthly), consider
				<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hirusi"
					>donating on Buy Me A Coffee</a
				>. Setting up a Patreon, which is what you might be familiar
				with, for the server costs at this time is overkill. We'd end up
				giving away in fees an equivalent amount of the little money
				that we do need.
			</p>

			<h3>Costs</h3>

			<p>
				<b>Hosting</b>: We spend <b>about 5.88 euros per month</b> to
				host this server including a very basic backups.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Domain name</b>: We paid about 5.2 US dollars to acquire the
				domain, but will need to pay close to
				<b>13.5 US dollars per year</b> to keep it.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Media server</b>: We also use a media CDN, the monthly cost
				for which is unknown at this point.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Labour</b>: Priceless. The server is managed by Ru in her
				free time. :)
