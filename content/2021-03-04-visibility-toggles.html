			<h1>How to use the visibility toggles while making a new toot.</h1>
			<time datetime="2021-03-04">04 March 2021</time>

			<p>
				Hometown can be a little confusing, even for those coming from
				the classic Mastodon experience.
			</p>

			<p>
				While it offers a nice ability to talk amongst SmallCampers
				*only*, and therefore you can share more personal content
				knowing you're in a safe-space, it can often be confusing how to
				achieve that.
			</p>

			<p>There are two toggles in the tooting interface:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Adjust post privacy</li>
				<li>Adjust status federation</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Not to sweat, post and status mean the same thing here: a toot.
				ðŸ˜Š
			</p>

			<!-- <p>The toggles look like this, respectively, highlighted with a yellow-border:</p> -->

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>To summarize...</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Public visibility <b>and</b> Local-only: I want everyone on
					SmallCamp to see this, regardless of whether they follow me
					or not.
				</li>
				<li>
					Public visibility <b>and</b> Federated: I want everyone on
					the fediverse to see this, regardless of whether they follow
					me or not.
				</li>
				<li>
					Private visibility <b>and</b> Local-only: I want only my
					followers on SmallCamp to see this.
				</li>
				<li>
					Private visibility <b>and</b> Federated: I want only my
					followers anywhere on the fediverse to see this, including
					both SmallCamp and other communities.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				It might seem scary to think <i>everyone</i> on the fediverse
				can see something you're posting. I promise you, most folks on
				Mastodon are actually very friendly. Communities that are, as a
				whole, not friendly or nefarious get blocked by most
				communities. We have done this too!
			</p>

			<p>
				With SmallCamp, the idea is to cultivate this friendliness more,
				and give you a comfortable space to share things that you might
				not share elsewhere. Feel free to use "Public visibility
				<b>and</b> Local-only" when posting something personal! ðŸ˜‰
